## 🏗️ Architecture & Technical Decisions

### State Management
- **Zustand** for global state (lightweight, TypeScript-friendly)
- Local state for component-specific data
- Custom hooks for API calls and data fetching

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- Custom components for reusability
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- CSS-in-JS for dynamic styles

### Performance Strategy
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Component memoization and lazy loading
- API response caching
- Debounced user inputs
- Virtual scrolling ready (for large datasets)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for pure components
- Integration tests for user interactions
- Custom hook testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing ready

## 🎯 Trade-offs & Decisions

### State Management Choice
- **Chosen:** Zustand over Redux Toolkit
- **Reason:** Simpler API, better TypeScript support, smaller bundle size
- **Trade-off:** Less ecosystem compared to Redux

### Animation Library
- **Chosen:** GSAP over Framer Motion
- **Reason:** Better performance, more control over animations
- **Trade-off:** Larger bundle size, steeper learning curve

### Testing Approach
- **Chosen:** Jest + RTL over Cypress
- **Reason:** Faster feedback, easier to maintain
- **Trade-off:** No end-to-end testing coverage

### API Caching
- **Chosen:** Custom hook over React Query
- **Reason:** Simpler implementation for current needs
- **Trade-off:** Less advanced caching features
